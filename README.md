## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Groq API key
- Deepgram API key (for advanced voice transcription)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-content-generation-assistant.git
   cd ai-content-generation-assistant
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your API keys:
   ```bash
   # For Linux/Mac
   export GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
   
   # For Windows
   set GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```

   Alternatively, replace the API keys directly in `backend.py` for testing purposes.

## üöÄ Usage

Run the application with a single command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
1. Start the FastAPI backend server
2. Launch the Streamlit frontend
3. Open the application in your default web browser

### Using the Application

1. **Select an Expert**: Choose the AI expert that best fits your current task from the sidebar
2. **Send a Message**: Type in the chat input or use the voice input button
3. **Review Response**: The AI will respond based on its expert role and previous context
4. **Edit if Needed**: Click the pencil icon to edit any AI response
5. **Build Content Iteratively**: Move between experts to refine your content

## üîÑ Workflow Example

1. Begin with the **Content Strategist** to outline your content goals
2. Switch to the **Research Assistant** to gather relevant information
3. Use the **Technical Writer** to create the initial draft
4. Refine with the **Editor** and verify facts with the **Fact Checker**
5. Optimize formatting with the **Format Specialist**
6. If creating spoken content, use the **Voice Processing Expert**
7. Conduct a final review with the **Quality Assurance Agent**

## üß† Memory System

The system uses two types of memory:
- **Chat History**: Complete conversation records for each expert
- **Long-term Memory**: Key points extracted from conversations

Experts inherit memory from relevant previous experts according to the workflow design. For example, the Technical Writer inherits memory from both the Content Strategist and Research Assistant.

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Experts

1. Define a new prompt template in `prompts.py`
2. Add the expert to the `SUPPORTED_SESSION_TYPES` list in `backend.py`
3. Update the `memory_inheritance` dictionary if needed
4. Add the expert to the dropdown in `frontend.py`

### Modifying Prompts

Expert behavior is controlled by prompt templates in `prompts.py`. Edit these to change how each expert responds to user input.
